# There are six possible fields to find on the pages: job_title, job_location, job_post_date, full_or_part, salary, info_link
#
# The only two required fields are job_title and info_link. Everything else is gravy.
#
# Use the examples from others below for traversing the HTML DOM tree for each page to pull out those fields
#
# When you're satisfied that your code is pulling the right fields, use this command to pop it into the database:
# insert_job(organization, job_title, job_location, job_post_date, full_or_part, salary, info_link)
